# TCLL 2x2 Algorithms
This is a simple repository to test Streamlit. Just a website that gives you algorithms for practicing TCLL, an advanced method for the 2x2 Rubik's Cube.

## How to use streamlit?
You just need to install it:
```bash
pip install streamlit
```
Then create your own program with Python an adapt it to streamlit. For this you'll need to import streamlit and then use the simple commands to create the website for it. It's really simple and good-looking.
```python
import streamlit as st
```
After you have everything set up, you need to run it with:
```bash
streamlit run your_script.py
```
If it works, you can go to the streamlit website and upload it by creating a repository in your GitHub account and then link it to streamlit. PD: you'll also need the proper requirements.txt (if corresponded).
